#Feedback/Discussion:

-The team originally began development with Vue but, after discussion and research, decided to switch to React. The main reason was Reactâ€™s significantly larger user base and community support, which provides more learning resources, tutorials, and troubleshooting examples. This will make the project more maintainable in the long run.

-We agreed to focus on football initially as the main displayed sport, since it allows us to refine the core functionality and UI around a single sport before expanding to support multiple sports in later versions.

-To improve scalability, the team restructured the application to make the pages more modular, which makes it easier to add new features and sports in the future.

-We also implemented a more dynamic front page, where different sports can be displayed in a slideshow-like fashion to improve user engagement and visual appeal.

-Looking ahead, the team plans to add in-depth player statistics, which will give users richer insights and provide more reasons to engage with the platform.

#Team Response:

-Agreed with the tutor that React was the more strategic choice for long-term success. Migration has already begun and core components have been refactored.

-Confirmed that starting with football keeps scope manageable, while still leaving room for scaling into all sports later.

-Adopted a modular approach to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.

-Designed and tested the new dynamic slideshow front page.

-Placed in-depth player stats on the roadmap for upcoming iterations.
