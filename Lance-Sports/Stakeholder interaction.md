## 🗓️ Entry 1 – 30/08/2025

### 📌 Feedback & Discussion

- The team originally began development with **Vue**, but after discussion and research, we decided to switch to **React**.
  - Reason: React has a **larger user base**, stronger community support, and more learning resources.
  - Benefit: Easier troubleshooting and long-term maintainability.

- For now, the focus will be on **football** as the primary displayed sport.
  - Once the core features are stable, the platform will expand to **all sports**.

- The application was restructured to make **pages more modular**.
  - This improves maintainability and makes it easier to scale with new sports and features.

- We added a **dynamic front page** with a slideshow effect cycling through different sports.
  - This enhances engagement and provides a more modern, interactive look.

- Future plans include adding **in-depth player statistics**.
  - This will give users richer insights and keep them engaged long term.

### ✅ Team Response

- Agreed that **React** is the better long-term choice. Migration is already underway, and core components have been refactored.
- Confirmed that starting with **football** is a manageable scope while leaving room to expand.
- Adopted a **modular design** approach to reduce technical debt.
- Implemented and tested the **dynamic slideshow front page**.
- Placed **in-depth player stats** on the development roadmap.
